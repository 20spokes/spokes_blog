Description:
   This sets up a basic blog structure. Make sure to run migrations afterwards! 

Example:
    rails generate spokes_blog

    This will create:
        Controllers:
          admin/spokes_blog/posts_controller.rb - admin ctrl
          spokes_blog/posts_controller.rb - public ctrl
        Models:
          spokes_blog/ - post, block, seo_meta
          spokes_blog/concerns - pageable
        Views (empty, mainly as api documentation)
          admin/spokes_blog/posts
          spokes_blog/posts
        Presenters
          presenters/presenter.rb - base presenter class
          presenters/post_presenter.rb
        Migrations
        It will also update routes.rb and application rb.
